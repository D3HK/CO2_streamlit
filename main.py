    st.write("Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing humanity in the 21st century. "
             "It is driven by the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, "
             "primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), which is generated from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, "
             "and natural gas. These emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming. "
             "Climate change is already impacting weather patterns, "
             "causing extreme natural phenomena such as hurricanes, "
             "floods, and droughts, while also resulting in biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystems.\n\n"

             "CO2 emissions negatively affect the environment by influencing ecological systems and human health. "
             "Rising temperatures lead to the melting of glaciers and an increase in sea levels, "
             "threatening coastal regions and island ecosystems. Additionally, climate change induces shifts in "
             "species distribution, which may result in the extinction of some species while others may find "
             "themselves in new, uncharted conditions. Furthermore, agricultural conditions are deteriorating: "
             "changes in precipitation and temperature can significantly reduce crop yields and food quality. "
             "Thus, the issue of climate change demands urgent and coordinated measures to reduce CO2 "
             "emissions and preserve our planet for future generations.")

             "from 1940 to 2023. As seen in the graph, CO‚ÇÇ emissions have significantly increased since "
             "the mid-20th century, a trend that correlates with industrialization, population growth, "
             "and an increase in the consumption of hydrocarbon resources. The most pronounced rise in "
             "emissions has occurred in recent decades, coinciding with peaks in economic development "
             "and urbanization. This trend raises serious concerns regarding climate change and its consequences "
             "for ecosystems and human health. Therefore, understanding the changes in carbon dioxide emissions "
             "over time is crucial for developing strategies to reduce their levels and mitigate the adverse "
             "effects on the environment.")
